# 📘 Edunet_Project

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship with **Edunet Foundation**, under the **AICTE Virtual Internship Program**. The project focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence and Python programming skills to solve real-world problems.

## 🧠 Project Title

**Sign Language Detection using Computer Vision**

## 🎯 Objective

To build an AI-powered application that detects and recognizes basic sign language gestures using a webcam and displays the corresponding text output. The goal is to assist communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV
  - MediaPipe
  - NumPy

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Edunet_Project.git
cd Edunet_Project
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

## 📸 Features

* Real-time hand tracking using webcam
* Sign gesture recognition
* Displays translated text on screen
* Easy to extend with more gestures
